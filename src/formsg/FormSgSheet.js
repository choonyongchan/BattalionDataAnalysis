/**
 * Receives Plumber's relayed FormSG submissions and appends one sheet row each.
 *
 * Plumber has already decrypted the submission, so the body that arrives here is
 * plain JSON keyed by this sheet's own column headers:
 *
 *     {
 *       "submissionId": "90fb87fbc8ad7733e37726a5",
 *       "submittedAt":  "2026-08-31T14:47:26.417+08:00",
 *       "answers": { "RANK": "LTA", "[Myinfo] Name": "PHUA CHU KANG", ... }
 *     }
 *
 * Two runtime constraints still shape this file:
 *
 * 1. ContentService always responds 200 — a status code cannot be set. So the two
 *    outcomes are deliberately distinguished:
 *      - permanent failure (a body that is not a submission): log it and return 200,
 *        because retrying will never change the result;
 *      - transient failure (lock contention, sheet unavailable): throw, which is the
 *        only way to produce a 5xx from Apps Script, so Plumber retries.
 *
 * 2. Apps Script web apps answer through a 302 redirect, which a webhook client can
 *    record as a failure even though doPost already ran and already wrote the row.
 *    appendIfNew_ therefore deduplicates on the submission id. This is the reason
 *    the append stayed in Apps Script rather than moving into Plumber, whose Sheets
 *    action appends unconditionally.
 *
 * The deployment must still be ANYONE_ANONYMOUS, because Plumber cannot authenticate
 * to Google. In front of that, the request must carry a shared secret matching the
 * FORMSG_INGEST_TOKEN script property, or it is rejected as `unauthorised`. Apps
 * Script cannot read request headers, so the token travels in the JSON body, exactly
 * as the parade-state route's does. The check fails closed: an unset property rejects
 * every request. See DeveloperGuide.md §8.4.
