/**
 * The project's single web-app entry point, dispatching to one intake per route.
 *
 * Apps Script allows exactly one `doPost` per project, but three callers now need
 * it: the FormSG report-sick relay from Plumber, the WhatsApp parade-state
 * bridge, and the dashboard. So the route is named explicitly in the query string:
 *
 *     .../exec?route=reportsick    -> FormSgSheet.handlePost   (Plumber)
 *     .../exec?route=paradestate   -> Parser.handlePost        (bridge)
 *     .../exec?route=dashboard     -> DashboardFeed.handlePost (dashboard)
 *
 * The first two write; the third only reads. It is routed through the same entry
 * point because a project gets one `doPost`, not because it shares anything else
 * with them — see docs/architecture_patterns.md.
 *
 * This is the one file that knows about all three. Everywhere else they stay
 * strictly independent.
 *
 * An unrouted or unknown request is rejected rather than defaulted to either
 * intake. Guessing would be worse than failing: a body meant for one handler
 * silently accepted by the other writes wrong rows to the wrong tab.
 *
 * Note that changes to this file only take effect after redeploying the web app
 * — a `clasp push` alone is not enough. See README.md.

/**
 * Receives every POST to the deployed web app and dispatches it by route.
 *
 * The deployment must allow anonymous access, because none of the three callers
 * can authenticate to Google — Plumber and the bridge have no Google identity,
 * and the dashboard is a static page with no credential to offer. So each route
 * carries its own shared-secret check against its own script property —
 * `Parser.isAuthorised_`, `FormSgSheet.isAuthorised_` and
 * `DashboardFeed.isAuthorised_` — kept separate so any one secret can be rotated
 * alone. All three fail closed when their property is unset. A shared secret is
 * the ceiling of what is possible here: Apps Script cannot read request headers.
 * See DeveloperGuide.md §8.4.
 *
 * @param {!Object} e The Apps Script doPost event object.
 * @returns {!GoogleAppsScript.Content.TextOutput} A JSON response body.
