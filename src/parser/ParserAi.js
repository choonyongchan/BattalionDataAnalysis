  static buildPrompt_(rawText) {
    return `You are extracting structured attendance data from a Singapore Army parade-state message (unstructured free text, formatting varies by author). Only record what's explicitly stated — never invent platoons, personnel, or command-team entries, and never guess a value that isn't stated; leave it null instead. Don't summarize, deduplicate, or infer an absence unless it's explicitly listed under a category section.

IDENTIFICATION
- "company": one of ${COMPANIES.join(', ')}, matched however it appears (e.g. "40 SAR ARCHER COMPANY" -> Archer, "BRAVES HQ" -> Braves). This battalion's own HQ element is called "Hercules": if the message says "HQ Company" (or similar) and names none of the other five, company is Hercules.
- "date": normalize any format (e.g. "220626", "22/06/26") to ISO "yyyy-MM-dd".
- "session": "FIRST PARADE STATE"/"FP" -> FPS; "LAST PARADE STATE"/"LP" -> LPS.

STRENGTH (platoons[])
- "platoons" always has exactly one entry with "platoon": "Company" and "unit_type": "Company", holding the message's overall total_strength/total_present — there is no separate top-level total field, the company total is just another platoons[] row.
- total_strength/total_present (on the Company row and every other row): resolve either a "present/total" fraction (e.g. "220/274" -> present 220, strength 274) or two separately labeled lines (e.g. "TOTAL STRENGTH: 136"/"CURRENT STRENGTH: 120") to two integers.
- Beyond the mandatory Company row, add one "platoons" entry per platoon/HQ/command-block the message actually breaks out (label it "1", "2", "HQ", etc.), each with its own total_strength/total_present. Add no further entries if the message has no such breakdown.
- "unit_type": "Company" for the mandatory total row, "PLATOON" for a numbered platoon, "HQ" for a headquarters block, "COMMAND_ELEMENT" for a company-wide command headcount not tied to a platoon number (e.g. "COMMANDERS: 20/25") — never "PLATOON" for that, it would double-count.
- Rank tiers ("Officer"/"OFFICER", "WOSPEC"/"WOSpec", "Enlistee"/"ENLISTEE"/"Men"/"TROOPERS" — same three tiers under different labels): whenever a block states a strength/present pair for one, fill officer_/wospec_/enlistee_strength+present. Leave null if that block doesn't state it.

PERSONNEL
- One entry per person/line-item under each category section (numbered "S/N", bulleted, or plain lists). The count next to a header (e.g. "OTHERS: 02") is frequently wrong in either direction — a header reading "00" may still have entries listed beneath it. Always count the actual listed entries and ignore the header's number; skip only headers with genuinely nothing beneath them.
- "platoon": the same label used in "platoons" if the entry sits inside that platoon's block, else null (company-wide/HQ-level entries).
- "reason_category": map the section heading to exactly one of:
  - Att C: "ATTC"/"ATT C"/"MC"
  - Status: "STATUS"/"MEDICAL STATUS"/"ON STATUS"
  - Off/Leave: "OFF/LEAVE"/"AL/OIL"/"LEAVE/OFF", and any leave entry — annual leave, off in lieu, hospitalisation leave
  - Report Sick: "REPORT SICK"/"REPORTING SICK"/"MR"
  - MA: "MA"/"MEDICAL APPT"/"MEDICAL APPOINTMENT"/"UPCOMING MA"
  - Others: anything else (DUTY, GUARD DUTY, OTHERS, UFD, courses, attachments, etc.)
  If a heading mixes concepts (e.g. "LEAVE/MA/OFF/COURSE"), classify each entry by its own reason text rather than the whole section at once.
- Split descriptive text into separate fields, never one combined remarks string:
  - "start_date"/"end_date": ISO "yyyy-MM-dd" bounds of any day-count and/or date range (e.g. "7D MC (170626-300626)" -> start "2026-06-17", end "2026-06-30"). A single date with no range (an appointment date, e.g. "Date: 220626") -> start_date = end_date = that date. Open-ended with only a start date (e.g. "...from 130526 onwards", "Permanent") -> start_date "2026-05-13", end_date null. Open-started with only an end date (e.g. "Excuse Stay-in until 260626") -> start_date null, end_date "2026-06-26". Null/null if no date at all is stated.
  - "num_days": the entry's own stated day-count as an integer, taken exactly as written (e.g. "7D ..." -> 7) even when it disagrees with the date range it sits next to — the stated figure is what the unit tracks. 1 for a single-date appointment. 1 for a duty stated with times that runs overnight into the next morning (e.g. "DATE & TIME: 180626 1630 - 190626 0800" -> 1, one duty, not two days). Null whenever no day-count is stated and the entry is not one of those two shapes — including open-ended and open-started entries. Never infer a count from the length of a date range.
  - "reason": the condition/appointment/duty text with the day-count, date range, and location removed (e.g. "7D MC (...)" -> "MC"; a stated time-of-day like "1100 Hrs" stays folded into reason, e.g. "Medical Appt (1100 Hrs)", since there's no separate time field). Never empty — repeat a short label here too if there's nothing beyond the duration.
  - "location": a place name explicitly stated anywhere in the entry — a "LOCATION:" line, or named in the reason prose (e.g. "Attached to Pulau Tekong Medical Centre ..." -> "Pulau Tekong Medical Centre"). Null if no place is named.
  - "in_camp": true/false only when explicitly stated as such (e.g. "Camp: In camp"/"Camp: Outside camp"); otherwise null. Never infer it from a location name, however obvious it seems.
  - "four_d": 3-6 digit unit ID (often "4D:"), else null. "rank" (e.g. "REC", "3SG"), else null.
- Multiple concurrent statuses under one S/N (e.g. several "21D Excuse ..." lines, or "14D X ... & 2D Y ..." on one line) must become separate personnel entries — one per status, repeating that person's name/rank/four_d/platoon/reason_category, varying only start_date/end_date/num_days/reason.

COMMAND TEAM
Lines like "CDO: 2LT RYAN" through "PDS 4: ..." each become one "command_team" entry: "role" normalized to CDO/CDS/COS/PDS1..PDS4 (no space before the number), "rank", "name" (text after the rank; if no rank prefix, rank null and name is the full text). Skip a role label with nothing after its colon. Empty array if the message has no such block.
