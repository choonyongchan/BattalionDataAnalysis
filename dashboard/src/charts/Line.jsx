/**
 * A trend over parade days, one line per company.
 *
 * The one thing this chart does differently from the implementation it replaces:
 * **`connectNulls` is false.** `js/charts.js` set it true and defended the choice in a
 * comment — a gapped line "reads as the rate having dropped to nothing". That defence is
 * wrong in this dataset. Only five of forty-five parade days carry all six companies, so
 * the holes are not rare accidents to be smoothed over; they are most of the picture. A
 * line drawn straight across a day nobody filed asserts a reading that was never taken,
 * and it asserts it in the same ink as the readings that were. The gap is the honest mark,
 * and the reader learns to see an unfiled day as a break in the line.
 *
 * Two annotation kinds ride on a carrier series rather than on the first data series, so
 * they survive a reader switching that company off in the legend: weekend bands behind the
 * plot in `--weekend-band`, and a vertical rule per public holiday in `--holiday-line`
 * carrying the holiday's name. A dip on a Saturday is a battalion that was not in camp,
 * not a battalion that got better, and without the band behind it the chart says the
 * second thing.
