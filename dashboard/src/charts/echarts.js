/**
 * The one place ECharts is assembled.
 *
 * ECharts ships as a registry: `echarts/core` is an empty engine, and every series type,
 * component and renderer has to be handed to `use()` before an option mentioning it will
 * draw. Importing the `echarts` barrel instead would register all of them — roughly a
 * megabyte of chart types this dashboard does not have — and defeat the code splitting
 * `vite.config.js` sets up for the ECharts chunk. So the registration happens once, here,
 * and no other file in the dashboard calls `use()`.
 *
 * Adding a chart type is therefore a two-line change in this file plus the component.
 * Forgetting the line shows up as an ECharts console error naming the missing type.
 *
 * `echarts-wordcloud` is a side-effect import: it registers its own series and view
 * against the same core, so it has to come after the core import, and it exports nothing
 * worth naming.
