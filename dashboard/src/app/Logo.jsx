/**
 * The dashboard's mark: the 40 SAR unit crest.
 *
 * A raster asset, not `currentColor` — a crest carries its own heraldic colours (gold,
 * red, the fist-and-rifles device) that would be lost if flattened to one theme-ink
 * colour, unlike the previous inline-SVG placeholder. The source file
 * (`40SARlogo.webp`, repo root) ships on a solid black square; `scripts/make-logo.py`
 * flood-fills that to transparency and crops to the crest's bounding box, so the same
 * asset sits cleanly on both the light and dark sidebar background.
