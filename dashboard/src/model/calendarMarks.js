 * camp" rather than "sickness collapsed". Public holidays come from an optional
 * "Public Holidays" tab — a battalion that has not created it still gets a working
 * dashboard, just without holiday lines, so nothing here may throw on an empty or
 * missing feed.
 *
 * Not using date-fns here: weekend grouping is a single pass over consecutive calendar
 * days, which `dates.js`'s `isWeekend` already answers per-day in UTC. date-fns adds
 * nothing a day-by-day scan does not already give for free.
 *
 * Every function here is pure.
