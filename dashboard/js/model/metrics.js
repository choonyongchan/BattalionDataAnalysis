/**
 * The numbers the dashboard puts on screen.
 *
 * Three rules run through this module, each learned from the data rather than assumed:
 *
 * **Counts are of soldiers, not rows.** A company that files both FPS and LPS lists the
 * same absentee twice, so every headcount deduplicates on identity within a date.
 *
 * **Comparisons are rates, not counts.** In the real data Braves shows 40 MC
 * rows against Hercules' 7, which says nothing until divided by strength — Braves is the
 * larger company. Anything compared across units is expressed as a percentage of the
 * days that unit was observed.
 *
 * **A missing company is stated, never absorbed.** If five of six companies have filed,
 * the battalion total is a total of five companies and the dashboard says so. A headline
 * that quietly omits a company is worse than no headline.
 *
 * Every function here is pure.
