/**
 * Duty classification and symptom extraction.
 *
 * Two jobs, both of which the dashboard's headline numbers rest on.
 *
 * **Classification is a category match, never a text match.** `Att C` *is* MC: Attend C
 * means excused all duties, and in national service that normally means resting at home
 * on a medical certificate. Every `Att C` row is therefore MC, including the ones whose
 * `reason` reads `HL`, `FEVER` or `FOOD POISONING` rather than the letters "MC".
 * Matching on the text instead would be wrong in both directions — it would miss those
 * three, and it would sweep in the `AFMC` rows (Air Force Medical Centre appointments,
 * filed under `Others`) and `RETURNING FROM MC`, which are not absences on MC at all.
 * `dashboard/test/classify.test.js` pins both directions.
 *
 * **Status is not absence.** `Status` is Attend B / light duty — excused specific
 * activities while still reporting for duty. Folding it into an absentee count would
 * overstate what the battalion cannot field, which is the most consequential mistake
 * this dashboard could make, so `EMPLOYABILITY` keeps the two apart.
 *
 * Every function here is pure.
