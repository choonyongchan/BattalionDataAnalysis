/**
 * Detection of first-parade-state messages.
 *
 * WhatsApp groups carry ordinary chatter alongside the parade states we care
 * about. This module decides, from the message text alone, whether a message is
 * worth relaying, so chatter never reaches the spreadsheet.
 *
 * Two gates, in order:
 *   1. Cheap structural gates reject anything too short, and anything that
 *      carries neither the "parade state" anchor phrase nor a first-parade
 *      marker ("FPS" / "FP") in its header. This alone rejects near-misses such
 *      as "Why is your parade state late?".
 *   2. A first-parade gate, since only first parade states are processed.
 *
 * Gate 1 accepts a terse header: some companies label a first parade state with
 * only "FPS" or "FP" and never write the words "parade state" at all. Those
 * still carry the full strength and personnel body, so the line and character
 * minimums below are what keep chatter out; the anchor phrase is no longer
 * mandatory on its own.
 *
 * There used to be a third stage: a score over six layout signals (strength
 * lines, present/total ratios, unit tokens, bracketed rank groups and so on),
 * needing three matches to accept. It is gone. Deciding whether a message is a
 * real parade state is what AiService and Validator do on the other side, and
 * they do it by reading the message rather than by guessing from its shape — so
 * the score was a second, weaker copy of a judgement already being made
 * downstream. What it added was a way to drop a genuine parade state whose
 * layout was merely unusual, with the rejection recorded nowhere. A message
 * that clears the gates but is not a parade state now lands on its own
 * "Parade State Responses" row marked ERROR, with the reason beside it, which
 * is visible and reversible.
