/**
 * Relays an accepted parade state to the Apps Script web app.
 *
 * This replaced a Google Form submission. The Form was a pure relay, there only
 * because `onFormSubmit` was the one trigger that fired reliably — an
 * installable trigger does not fire for API writes, so nothing happened when
 * the sheet was written directly. Posting to the web app removes the hop, the
 * scraped `entry.<digits>` id and the script that discovered it: the handler
 * appends the row and runs the pipeline in one call.
 *
 * Redirects are followed. An Apps Script web app answers through a 302, and
 * following it re-sends the POST body, so the handler can run twice for one
 * call. That is safe here precisely because the handler dedupes on
 * `messageId` — see DeveloperGuide.md §8.3.
